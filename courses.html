							<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Personality Development</h3>
							<p>Importance of Personality Development<br>

								People are unaware about the importance of Personality Development. This is due to lack of counseling and guidance. Millions of Indian students have low self-confidence and are fearful of public speaking. This leads to poor performance in college and job interviews. Most of the schools in India do not provide personality development training to students. Such programmes are useful and help students to work on their latent skills. Areas like body language, confidence building, public speaking, idea generation, creative and critical thinking etc. should be taught at school level as they are tested once an individual starts his career. It is not something to be taken for granted and its importance should be taught to students from a very young age
								<br>
								Need of developing professional skills
								<br>Professional skills are something that is not inborn and should be learnt by every individual. A person with remarkable professional skills will excel much better than a person with poor professional conduct. Skills like organisation skills, work efficiency, language skills, presentation skills etc. are a must to learn by every individual. Thus, personality development is not limited to speaking in good English. It means to work on your weaknesses, strengthening your forte and polishing those essential skills. Personality development also means to become successful while retaining those humane skills.
								<br>
								
								Key Features of the Course:
								<br>
								1.Create a dynamic, expressive persona that radiates authenticity.
								<br>2. Engage in conversation with ease and agility.
								<br>3. Present your message with passion and purpose
								<br>4. Connect to the power of positive thoughts to build confidence.
								<br>
								Filling the GAP:
								
								<br>G- Grooming 
								<br>A - Attitude 
								<br>P - Personality
